conf.KDE.in talks
=================

This repository contains the code and notes for the two
[talks](http://conf.kde.in/talks) I will be giving
in March at [conf.KDE.in](http://conf.kde.in), the first KDE conference held in
India.

Scripting a Qt Story
--------------------

An introduction to the powerful QtScript module and its integration with Qt and
your programs.

Slides are a PDF of the Prezi.com presentation

Setting up a KDE development environment
----------------------------------------

Interested in contributing to KDE? This talk will help you set up the
environment to do so. This talk has incomplete slides since the talk was
dropped
in favour of a bug fixing lab.
